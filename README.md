## Contents

1. `python-language-tutorial.ipynb`: a tutorial mainly around the _language_ of Python, i.e. the syntax, the data structures, the control flow, etc. This was formerly the primary tutorial during CLMS orientation, before Python was the required language in the core sequence.
2. `python-ecosystem.ipynb`: a tutorial focused more around the _ecosystem_ of Python: advanced language features, package management, editors, and whatnot.
